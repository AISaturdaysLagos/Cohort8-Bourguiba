Features and overview,"Use a shared decision-making approach to discuss options for OUD treatment. Medication-Assisted Therapy (MAT) is the first-line treatment for OUD. The preferred OUD treatment is Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT). Opioid agonist treatment involves taking opioid agonist medications such as buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) or methadone. Methadone must be provided through a federally regulated opioid treatment program for OUD therapy. The alternative OUD treatment is extended-release (ER) injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol). MAT can be provided in a variety of treatment settings including residential SUD treatment, intensive outpatient SUD treatment, regular SUD specialty care clinic, primary care or general mental health clinic, or federally regulated opioid treatment program. Moral injury is an act of transgression that leads to serious inner conflict typically brought on by betrayal, disproportionate violence, incidents involving civilians, within-rank violence. For moral injury, treatment via psychologists or chaplains is available. Central sensitization (e .g., fibromyalgia, chronic headaches, and likely many other types of complex chronic pain). Some examples of medical complications are lung disease, hepatic disease, renal disease, or fall risk. Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder.",Name a sleep disorder.,Sleep apnea
Recommendations,"If prescribing opioids, we recommend prescribing the lowest dose of opioids as indicated by patient-specific risks and benefits. (Strong for | Reviewed, New-replaced) Note: There is no absolutely safe dose of opioids. As opioid dosage and risk increase, we recommend more frequent monitoring for adverse events including opioid use disorder and overdose. Risks for opioid use disorder start at any dose and increase in a dose-dependent manner. • Risks for overdose and death significantly increase at a range of 20-50 mg morphine equivalent daily dose. (Strong for | Reviewed, New- replaced)  We recommend against opioid doses over 90 mg morphine equivalent daily dose for treating chronic pain. (Strong against | Reviewed, New-replaced) Note: For patients who are currently prescribed doses over 90 mg morphine equivalent daily dose, evaluate for tapering to reduced dose or to discontinuation (see Recommendations 14 and 15). ",What is the recommended dose of opioids?,the lowest dose of opioids as indicated by patient-specific risks and benefits
Algorithm,"When safety allows, a gradual taper rate (5-10% reduction every 4 weeks) allows time for neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral adaptations. When there are concerns regarding risks of tapering (e.g., unmasked OUD, exacerbation of underlying mental health conditions), consider interdisciplinary services that may include mental health, SUD, primary care, and specialty pain care. Address concerns that may negatively impact taper (e.g., inability for adequate follow-up, inability to provide adequate treatment for co-occurring medical and mental health conditions and SUD). Patient and treatment characteristics to consider when determining tapering strategy are as follows: opioid dose, duration of therapy, type of opioid formulation, psychiatric, medical and SUD comorbidities and other patient risk factors (e.g., non-adherence, high-risk medication-related behavior, strength of social support, and coping).",What to do when there are concerns regarding risks of tapering?,"consider interdisciplinary services that may include mental health, SUD, primary care, and specialty pain care"
Algorithm,"Module C is on tapering or discontinuation of opioid therapy. If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient’s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., “chemical coping”), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper.

Background information,"The CDC released its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, directed toward primary care physicians, on March 15, 2016. The aim of the guideline is to assist primary care providers in offering safe and effective treatment for patients with chronic pain in the outpatient setting (not including active cancer treatment, palliative care, or end-of-life care). It is also aimed at improving communication between providers and patients and decreasing adverse outcomes associated with LOT. The CDC guideline,  similar to the VA/DoD OT CPG, covered topics including initiation and continuation of OT, management of  OT, and risk assessment and use of risk mitigation strategies. It also used the GRADE system to assign a  grade for the strength for each recommendation which includes assessment of the quality of the evidence and consideration of the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, patient values and preferences,  and other considerations (e.g., resource use, equity) during recommendation development.

Features and overview,"When formulating an opioid taper plan, determine if the initial goal is a dose reduction or complete discontinuation. If the initial goal is determined to be a dose reduction, subsequent regular reassessment may indicate that complete discontinuation is more suitable. Several factors go into the speed of the selected taper. Slower, more gradual tapers are often the most tolerable and can be completed over several months to years based on the opioid dose. The longer the duration of previous opioid therapy, the longer the taper may take. Most commonly, tapering will involve dose reduction of 5% to 20% every 4 weeks. More rapid tapers may be required in certain instances like drug diversion, illegal activities, or situations where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper. Document the rationale for the opioid taper and the opioid taper schedule in the Veteran’s medical record. Provide opioid overdose education and prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk of overdose. Strongly caution patients that it takes as little as a week to lose their tolerance and that they are at risk of an overdose if they resume their original dose. Patients are at an increased risk of overdose during this process secondary to reduced tolerance to opioids and the availability of opioids and heroin in the community.",In which instances more rapid tapers may be required?,"drug diversion, illegal activities, or situations where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper"

Background information,"Chronic pain is among the most common, costly, and disabling chronic medical conditions in the U.S. In the U.S., approximately 100 million adults experience chronic pain, and pain is associated with  approximately 20% of ambulatory primary care and specialty visits. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, the proportion of pain visits during which patients  received opioids has increased significantly, as have opioid-related morbidity, mortality, overdose death,  and SUD treatment admissions. Approximately one in five patients with non-cancer pain or pain related diagnoses is prescribed opioids in office-based settings. According to the CDC, sales of  prescription opioids U.S. quadrupled from 1999 and 2014. The absolute number of deaths associated  with use of opioids has increased four-fold since 2000, including by 14% from 2013 to 2014 alone.  Between 1999 and 2015, more than 183,000 people died from overdoses related to prescription  opioids. In one survey, approximately one-third of patients receiving OT for CNCP (or their family  members) indicated thinking that they were “addicted” to or “dependent” on the medication or used the  medication for “fun” or to “get high.” From 2000 through 2013, the rate of heroin overdose deaths  increased nearly four-fold. In the 2000s, the majority of people entering treatment for heroin use used  prescription opioids as their first opioid.","Since when has there been a significant increment of opioid-related morbidity, mortality, overdose death, and SUD treatment admissions?",the late 1990s and early 2000s
Recommendations,"In addition to benzodiazepines, the addition of other psychoactive medications to LOT must be made with  caution. While the evidence for harm associated with the combination of opioids and Z-drugs (e.g.,  zolpidem, eszopiclone) is not as strong as the evidence for harm associated with the combination of  opioids and benzodiazepines, we suggest not prescribing Z-drugs to patients who are on LOT, as moderate  quality evidence demonstrates that the combination of zolpidem and opioids increases the AOR of  overdose.[66] The evidence reviewed also identifies potential adverse outcomes (e.g., risk of overdose)  with the combined use of antidepressants and opioids in patients who do not have depression.[66] This  particular study did not differentiate between classes of antidepressants, limiting the ability of the Work  Group to recommend for or against prescribing opioids and a specific class of antidepressants. As such,  there is no recommendation in this guideline with respect to using specific classes of antidepressants and  LOT.

Features and overview,"Rapid Taper is done over days. Rapid tapers can cause withdrawal effects and patients should be treated with adjunctive medications to minimize these effects; may need to consider admitting the patient for inpatient care. If patients are prescribed both long-acting and short-acting opioids, the decision about which formulation to be tapered first should be individualized based on medical history, mental health diagnoses, and patient preference. Data shows that overdose risk is greater with long-acting preparations. In rapid taper, reduce opioid by 20 to 50% of first dose if needed, then reduce by 10 to 20% every day. An example of the rapid taper is given below. During the first day in the rapid taper, 33% reduction of morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 MEDD consists of 60 mg SR (15 mg x 4) Q8h. The subsequent daily dosage for the rapid taper is 45 mg SR (15 mg x 3) Q8h for day 2, 30 mg SR (15 mg x 2) Q8h for day 3, 15 mg SR Q8h for day 4, 15 mg SR Q12h for day 5-7, 15 mg SR QHS for day 8-11. Stop rapid tapering after day 11 and may consider morphine IR 15 mg ½ tablet (7.5 mg) twice daily.","When reducing 33% of morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 MEDD on day 1, what dose should be taken on day ten of the rapid opioid tapering?",15 mg SR QHS
Features and overview,"Slowest taper is done over years. In the slowest taper, reduce opioid by 2 to 10% every 4 to 8 weeks with pauses in taper as needed. Consider the slowest taper for patients taking high doses of long-acting opioids for many years. An example of the slowest taper is given below. During the first month in the slowest taper, 5% reduction of morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 MEDD consists of 90 mg SR qam, 75 mg for noon, 90 mg qpm. Continue the taper based on Veteran response. Pauses in the taper may allow the patient time to acquire new skills for management of pain and emotional distress while allowing for neurobiological equilibration. The subsequent monthly dosage for the slowest taper is 75 mg SR qam, 75 mg noon, 90 mg qpm for month 2; 75 mg SR (60 mg+15 mg) Q8h for month 3; 75 mg SR qam, 60 mg noon, 75 mg qpm for month 4; 60 mg SR qam, 60 mg noon, 75 mg qpm for month 5; 60 mg SR Q8h for month 6; 60 mg SR qam, 45 mg noon, 60 mg qpm for month 7; 45 mg SR qam, 45 mg noon, 60 mg qpm for month 8; 45 mg SR Q8h for month 9.

Features and overview,"Follow up in the first 1 to 4 weeks of taper. If Veteran feels supported and is adjusting to the dose reduction, continue the strategy of reducing to morphine SR 30 mg every 8 hours, follow up in 1 to 4 weeks to determine the next step in the taper. If Veteran strongly resists reduction, then request mental health support and consider the possibility of OUD. If the Veteran is resisting further dose reductions, explore the reason for the reluctance. The reasons for the reluctance can be medical (increased pain), mental health (worsening depression, anxiety, etc.), and substance use disorder (SUD)/opioid use disorder (OUD).

Recommendations,"We strongly recommend against initiation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. We recommend alternatives to opioid therapy such as self-management strategies and other non-pharmacological treatments. When pharmacologic therapies are used, we recommend non-opioids over opioids.

Note: Consideration of opioid therapy beyond 90 days requires reevaluation and discussion with patient of risks and benefits.",What is recommended if prescribing opioid therapy for patients with chronic pain?,a short duration
Recommendations,"There is moderate quality evidence from retrospective cohort and retrospective case-control studies  indicating that risk of prescription opioid overdose and overdose death exists even at low opioid dosage levels and increases with increasing doses. Significant risk (approximately 1.5 times) exists at a daily dosage range of 20 to <50 mg MEDD and further increases (approximately 2.6 times) at a range of 50 to <100 mg MEDD compared to risk at <20 mg MEDD. Risk continues to increase at higher dosage ranges (≥100 mg  MEDD) (Table 2).[58,59,66,133]  ",How much does the risk increase at a daily dosage range of 20 to <50 mg MEDD?,approximately 1.5 times
Algorithm,"Factors requiring immediate attention and possible discontinuation are as follows: untreated SUD, unstable mental health disorder, medical condition that acutely increases opioid risks (e.g., compromised or worsening cognitive or cardiopulmonary status), other factors that acutely increase risk of overdose (recent overdose, current sedation, recent motor vehicle accident), acutely elevated suicide risk. The risks of continuing opioid therapy are as follows: increase in all-cause mortality, increase risk of unintentional overdose death, increase risk of developing OUD, risk of developing or worsening - depression, falls, fractures, sleep disordered breathing, worsening pain, motor vehicle accidents hypogonadism, prolonged pain, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, sedation, cognitive dysfunction, immune system dysfunction, reduction in function, reduction in quality of life. The benefits of continuing opioid therapy are modest short-term improvement in pain, possible short-term improvement in function. Some talking points for education and re-education for patients currently on OT are “Doctors used to think that opioids were safe and effective when used for long periods of time to treat chronic pain.”, “New information has taught us that long-term opioid use can lead to multiple problems including loss of pain relieving effects, increased pain, unintentional death, OUD, and problems with sleep, mood, hormonal dysfunction, and immune dysfunction,”, “We now know that the best treatments for chronic pain are not opioids. The best treatments for chronic pain are non-drug treatments such as psychological therapies and rehabilitation therapies and non-opioid medications.”.",What are the risks of continuing opioid therapy?,"increase in all-cause mortality, increase risk of unintentional overdose death, increase risk of developing OUD, risk of developing or worsening - depression, falls, fractures, sleep disordered breathing, worsening pain, motor vehicle accidents hypogonadism, prolonged pain, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, sedation, cognitive dysfunction, immune system dysfunction, reduction in function, reduction in quality of life"
Algorithm,"Module B is about treatment with opioid therapy. The treatment of opioid therapy is provided to the candidate for trial of OT with consent (in conjunction with a comprehensive pain care plan). Initiate OT using the following approach: short duration (e.g., 1 week initial prescription; no more than 3 months total), use the lowest effective dose recognizing that no dose is completely safe, long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals, consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl, assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects, offer overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND). A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk and has not been shown to improve function. Dose escalation above 20-50 mg MEDD has not been shown to improve function and increase risk. If a patient is medically or psychiatrically unstable, then admit/provide medical and psychiatric treatment to stabilize as indicated. If a patient is not medically or psychiatrically unstable, then see if there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors. If there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan (e.g., non-opioid treatments, self-management strategies). If there is no clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then taper to discontinuation (consult Module C if needed), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. Follow-up frequently based on patient risk factors (e.g., 1-4 weeks with any dose change; up to every 3 months without dose change if clinically and functionally stable). During a follow-up, assess function, risks, and benefits of OT, progress toward functional treatment goals, adverse effects, adherence to treatment plan, complications or co-occurring conditions (e.g., medical, mental health, and/or SUD); complete risk mitigation strategies; review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan. The factors that increase risks of OT are non-adherence, co-occurring conditions, behaviors suggesting OUD, indications for referral. If these factors are present, then consider one or more of the following: shortening prescribing interval, intensifying risk mitigation strategies, increasing intensity of monitoring, referring to interdisciplinary care and consulting with or referring to specialty care. If the factors that increase risks of OT are not present, then see if there are indications to discontinue or taper. If there are indications to discontinue or taper, then taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation. If there are no indications to discontinue or taper, then reassess in 1-3 months or more frequently as determined by patient risk factors.",What to do if a patient is not medically or psychiatrically unstable?,see if there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors
Recommendations,"Some patients with SUD may disagree with the recommendation to use non-opioid modalities in lieu of  LOT to treat their pain. However, the lack of evidence of efficacy of LOT and considerable evidence of  significant harms of overdose, death from overdose, and increased risk of suicide outweigh any potential  modest benefit of prescribing LOT in this population.

Recommendations,"There is concern for additional overdose risk associated with long-acting versus short-acting opioids. A  study (not included in the evidence review due to its design) suggests increased risk for non-fatal overdose  in VA patients with initiation of a long-acting opioid compared with immediate-release opioids.[137] Also,  recent research demonstrates that patients with CNCP on long-acting OT have a significantly increased risk  of all-cause mortality compared to patients with CNCP who are taking an analgesic anticonvulsants or a  low-dose antidepressant.[10]  ",Who has a significantly increased risk  of all-cause mortality compared to patients with CNCP who are taking an analgesic anticonvulsants or a  low-dose antidepressant?,patients with CNCP on long-acting OT
Features and overview,"Offer risk mitigation strategies, including naloxone for patients at risk for overdose.  Review PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) data at least every 3 months and perform UDT (Urine Drug Testing) at least annually.

Background information,"The U.S. is in the midst of a cultural transformation in the way pain is viewed and treated. The biomedical model of pain care, in which the pain experience is reduced to a pain generator and pain treatment is aimed at fixing or numbing pain with medications, interventions, or surgery, dominated the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s. As the cost, potential harm, and limited effectiveness of the approach in the biomedical model of pain care to chronic pain was becoming apparent, the National Academy of Medicine issued a call for the transformation of pain care to a biopsychosocial, multimodal, interdisciplinary model.",Which model was adopted after the biomedical model of pain care?,"a biopsychosocial, multimodal, interdisciplinary model"
Features and overview,"Use a shared decision-making approach to discuss options for OUD treatment. Medication-Assisted Therapy (MAT) is the first-line treatment for OUD. The preferred OUD treatment is Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT). Opioid agonist treatment involves taking opioid agonist medications such as buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) or methadone. Methadone must be provided through a federally regulated opioid treatment program for OUD therapy. The alternative OUD treatment is extended-release (ER) injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol). MAT can be provided in a variety of treatment settings including residential SUD treatment, intensive outpatient SUD treatment, regular SUD specialty care clinic, primary care or general mental health clinic, or federally regulated opioid treatment program. Moral injury is an act of transgression that leads to serious inner conflict typically brought on by betrayal, disproportionate violence, incidents involving civilians, within-rank violence. For moral injury, treatment via psychologists or chaplains is available. Central sensitization (e .g., fibromyalgia, chronic headaches, and likely many other types of complex chronic pain).

Background information,"Government agencies, including the VA, DoD, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA), have also launched initiatives to improve the study and treatment of pain and  adverse events associated with opioid analgesics such as OUD and overdose. By August 2013, the VA  deployed the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) requirements to all Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISNs) with the aim of ensuring opioids are used in a safe, effective, and judicious manner. The goals of  the OSI related to such topics as increased education, monitoring, use of safe and effective prescribing and  management methods, tool development, collaboration, and use of alternative pain treatment. The OSI  uses the Veterans Health Administration (VHA’s) electronic health record to identify patients who may be  high-risk for adverse outcomes with use of opioids and providers whose prescribing practices do not  reflect best evidence so that patient care can be improved. The OSI requirements include specific  indicators (e.g., the number of unique pharmacy patients dispensed an opioid, the unique patients on LOT who have received UDT). As part of the OSI, the VA launched the Opioid Overdose Education and  Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, which was implemented as a risk mitigation strategy aimed at  reducing deaths from opioid overdose. The program components included education and training  regarding the following topics: opioid overdose prevention, recognition, and rescue response; risk  mitigation strategies; and issuing naloxone kits, which can be used as an antidote to opioid  overdose.",What was the aim of the Opioid Safety Initiative?,"ensuring opioids are used in a safe, effective, and judicious manner."
Recommendations,"Patients may decline offered treatments (e.g., OT) and may also decline risk mitigation strategies (e.g.,  UDT, pill counts) that are recommended in the course of clinical care. However, providers should discuss  this decision with the patient, including the likelihood that their decision may result in the risks of LOT  outweighing its potential benefits. This would require a consideration of patient’s safety, and a clinical  decision may be made not to initiate OT or to discontinue ongoing OT through tapering (see  Recommendation 14 and Recommendation 17). ",What may patients decline?,"offered treatments (e.g., OT) and may also decline risk mitigation strategies (e.g.,  UDT, pill counts) that are recommended in the course of clinical care"
Background information,"Evidence for or history of diversion of controlled substances: The clinician should communicate to patients that drug diversion is a crime and constitutes an absolute contraindication to prescribing additional medications. Because suspicion is subjective and may be based on impression, bias, or prejudice, it is important that providers who suspect diversion base treatment plans on objective evidence. Suspicions may be confirmed by a negative mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography UDT for the substance being prescribed in the absence of withdrawal symptoms in someone who is receiving opioids. A negative UDT for the prescribed opioid could also by itself be a sign of diversion. Signs of diversion may also include frequent requests for early refills or atypically large quantities required to control pain. Routine UDT, however, may not reliably detect synthetic opioids (e.g., methadone, fentanyl, tramadol) or semi-synthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone). When there is evidence that the patient is diverting opioids, discontinue opioids according to Recommendations 14 and 15 and assess for underlying OUD and/or psychiatric comorbidities. Consultation with a pain specialist, psychiatrist, or SUD specialist may be warranted. Also consider consultation with local risk management and/or counsel. For patients with OUD, keep in mind that sudden discontinuation of opioids due to suspected diversion may place them at high risk for illicit opioid use and resulting opioid overdose (see Recommendation 17).",What are some examples of synthetic opioids?,"methadone, fentanyl, tramadol"
Recommendations,"Community-based Needle Exchange Programs or Syringe Service Programs: Nearly 80% of new users of injectable opioids had previously used prescription oral opioid pain medication.[118,119] Illicit use of injectable opioids is accompanied by an increased rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis infection. Community-based needle exchange programs have been shown to be an effective risk mitigation strategy for reducing high-risk behaviors (e.g., sharing needles) and infectious disease transmission among injection drug users.[120] For those patients who develop OUD and progress to intravenous drug use, the first recommendation should be for medication assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD (see Recommendation 17). For patients who decline MAT for OUD,  clinicians should consider educating the patient regarding sterile injection techniques and community based needle exchange programs, if programs are available. The 2015 outbreak of HIV/hepatitis in rural  Indiana and subsequent successful implementation of a needle exchange program is an example of the threat to rural communities from non-prescription opioid use and the potential benefits of needle exchange programs for use as a risk mitigation strategy.[121,122]  ",What is an example of the threat to rural communities from non-prescription opioid use and the potential benefits of needle exchange programs for use as a risk mitigation strategy?,The 2015 outbreak of HIV/hepatitis in rural  Indiana and subsequent successful implementation of a needle exchange program
Features and overview,"Short-term oral medications can be utilized to assist with managing the withdrawal symptoms, especially when prescribing fast tapers. Do not treat withdrawal symptoms with an opioid or benzodiazepine. Withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening and may not be seen with a gradual taper. Early symptoms take hours to days to appear. Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone). Some symptoms of withdrawal such as dysphoria, insomnia and prolonged craving may take longer. Patients with chronic pain may find that symptoms, such as fatigue, mental functioning, pain, and well-being, improve over time.",How long does it take to resolve early symptoms?,"5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone)"
Algorithm,"Module D is for patients currently on opioid therapy. For patients currently on OT, look for factors that would require immediate attention and possible discontinuation of OT due to unacceptable risk. If there are factors that would require immediate attention, then admit/provide treatment to stabilize, including opioid tapering or SUD treatment as indicated. If there are no factors that would require immediate attention, then obtain a biopsychosocial assessment. If prior medical records including current prescriber, prior and current UDT, PDMP are available for review, then review data and re-assess risks and benefits of continuing OT and consider strength and number of risk factors. If unavailable, then address factors related to incomplete data prior to prescribing. Then review data and re-assess risks and benefits of continuing OT and consider strength and number of risk factors. If risks outweigh benefits of continuing OT, then proceed to module C. If risks do not outweigh benefits of continuing OT, then educate/re-educate on the following: non-opioid management, self-management to improve function and quality of life, realistic expectations and limitations of medical treatment options, preferred treatment methods being non-pharmacotherapy and non-opioid pharmacotherapy, new information on risks and lack of benefits of long-term OT. After educating/re-educating the patient, identify if there is presence of prescribed opioid dose>90 mg MEDD or combined sedating medication that increases risk of adverse events (e.g., benzodiazepine) or patient non-participation in a comprehensive pain care plan or other indications for tapering. If any of these are present, then proceed to module C. Otherwise, reassess and optimize preferred non-opioid treatments for chronic pain (e.g., physical and psychological treatments) recognizing that the patient is willing to continue to engage in a comprehensive treatment plan including non-opioid treatments. If the patient is experiencing clear functional improvement with minimal risk, then continue OT using the following approach: shortest duration, using lowest effective dose (recognizing that no dose is completely safe and overdose risk increases at doses > 20-50 mg MEDD), continual assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects. Then proceed to follow-up frequently based on patient risk factors. Otherwise, proceed to module C. ",What to do for patients currently on OT?,look for factors that would require immediate attention and possible discontinuation of OT due to unacceptable risk
Features and overview,"When formulating an opioid taper plan, determine if the initial goal is a dose reduction or complete discontinuation. If the initial goal is determined to be a dose reduction, subsequent regular reassessment may indicate that complete discontinuation is more suitable. Several factors go into the speed of the selected taper. Slower, more gradual tapers are often the most tolerable and can be completed over several months to years based on the opioid dose. The longer the duration of previous opioid therapy, the longer the taper may take. Most commonly, tapering will involve dose reduction of 5% to 20% every 4 weeks. More rapid tapers may be required in certain instances like drug diversion, illegal activities, or situations where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper. Document the rationale for the opioid taper and the opioid taper schedule in the Veteran’s medical record. Provide opioid overdose education and prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk of overdose. Strongly caution patients that it takes as little as a week to lose their tolerance and that they are at risk of an overdose if they resume their original dose. Patients are at an increased risk of overdose during this process secondary to reduced tolerance to opioids and the availability of opioids and heroin in the community.",Which tapers may be required in certain instances like illegal activities?,More rapid tapers

Background information,"Current or history of SUD: For patients with untreated SUD, see Recommendation 4. For  patients with diagnosed OUD, see Recommendation 17. Frequent requests for early refills or atypically large quantities required to control pain can signal an emerging SUD as well as  diversion (see Evidence for or history of diversion of controlled substances). See the VA/DoD  SUD CPG.4 Depression or history of depression: Zedler et al. (2014) reported that among patients  being treated by the VHA system that received opioids, a history of depression was  significantly associated with opioid-related toxicity/overdose compared to no history of  depression.[58] LOT has been associated with worsening depressive symptoms.[63] See the  VA/DoD MDD CPG.5 PTSD: Seal et al. (2012) (n=15,676) noted that among patients on OT, a prevalence of self inflicted injuries was significantly higher among patients with a history of PTSD (with or  without other mental health diagnoses) as compared to patients with other (or no) mental  health diagnoses.[65] For more information, see the VA/DoD PTSD CPG.6 History of drug overdose: A history of overdose is a red flag and providers should proceed with  utmost caution when considering LOT for these patients.

Algorithm,"Module C is on tapering or discontinuation of opioid therapy. If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient’s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., “chemical coping”), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper.

Features and overview,"Slowest taper is done over years. In the slowest taper, reduce opioid by 2 to 10% every 4 to 8 weeks with pauses in taper as needed. Consider the slowest taper for patients taking high doses of long-acting opioids for many years. An example of the slowest taper is given below. During the first month in the slowest taper, 5% reduction of morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 MEDD consists of 90 mg SR qam, 75 mg for noon, 90 mg qpm. Continue the taper based on Veteran response. Pauses in the taper may allow the patient time to acquire new skills for management of pain and emotional distress while allowing for neurobiological equilibration.

Recommendations,"Psychological therapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  [CBT], biofeedback) have been found to be effective for pain reduction in multiple pain conditions.[80-82] Exercise treatments, including yoga, also have evidence of benefit for reducing pain intensity and disability  when compared to usual care in the treatment of chronic pain conditions.[83-85] Exercise and  psychological therapies may each exert their influence through multiple mechanisms including but not  limited to the reduction in fear-avoidance, reduction in catastrophizing, and/or enhancing mood.[80]  Similarly, multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (described as a combination of a physical  intervention such as graded exercise and a psychological, social, or occupational intervention) has been  shown to be more effective than usual care in improving pain and disability.[81] These interventions are  safe and have not been shown to increase morbidity or mortality. In light of the low harms associated with exercise and psychological therapies when compared with LOT these treatments are preferred over LOT, and should be offered to all patients with chronic pain including  those currently receiving LOT.

Algorithm,"Module C is on tapering or discontinuation of opioid therapy. If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient’s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., “chemical coping”), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper.

Algorithm,"Necessary risk mitigation strategies are OEND, UDT, PDMP, face-to-face follow-up with frequency determined by risk. Indications for tapering and discontinuation are as follows: risks of OT outweigh benefits, patient preference, diversion. Risks of opioid therapy outweigh benefits under the following circumstances: lack of clinically meaningful improvement in function, concomitant use of medications that increase risk of overdose, co-occurring medical or mental health conditions that increase risk, concerns about OUD or other SUD, patient non-compliance with opioid safety measures and opioid risk mitigation strategies, patient non-participation in a comprehensive pain care plan, prescribed dose higher than the maximal recommended dose, pain condition not effectively treated with opioids (e.g., back pain with normal MRI; fibromyalgia), medical or mental health comorbidities that increase risk, improvement in the underlying pain condition being treated, unmanageable side effects. Factors that may indicate need for more frequent follow-up are non-adherence to comprehensive pain care plan (e.g., attendance at appointment), unexpected UDT and PDMP results, non-adherence to opioid prescription (e.g., using more than prescribed and/or running out early), higher risk medication characteristics (e.g., high-dose opioids, combination of opioids and benzodiazepines), patients with mental health, medical, or SUD comorbidities that increase risk for adverse outcomes. MEDD refers to morphine equivalent daily dose; MRI refers to magnetic resonance imaging; OEND refers to Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution.",What is MEDD?,morphine equivalent daily dose
Algorithm,"Factors requiring immediate attention and possible discontinuation are as follows: untreated SUD, unstable mental health disorder, medical condition that acutely increases opioid risks (e.g., compromised or worsening cognitive or cardiopulmonary status), other factors that acutely increase risk of overdose (recent overdose, current sedation, recent motor vehicle accident), acutely elevated suicide risk. The risks of continuing opioid therapy are as follows: increase in all-cause mortality, increase risk of unintentional overdose death, increase risk of developing OUD, risk of developing or worsening - depression, falls, fractures, sleep disordered breathing, worsening pain, motor vehicle accidents hypogonadism, prolonged pain, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, sedation, cognitive dysfunction, immune system dysfunction, reduction in function, reduction in quality of life. The benefits of continuing opioid therapy are modest short-term improvement in pain, possible short-term improvement in function. Some talking points for education and re-education for patients currently on OT are “Doctors used to think that opioids were safe and effective when used for long periods of time to treat chronic pain.”, “New information has taught us that long-term opioid use can lead to multiple problems including loss of pain relieving effects, increased pain, unintentional death, OUD, and problems with sleep, mood, hormonal dysfunction, and immune dysfunction,”, “We now know that the best treatments for chronic pain are not opioids.

Features and overview,"Consider use of adjuvant medications during the taper to reduce withdrawal symptoms. The first-line treatment option for autonomic symptoms such as sweating, tachycardia, myoclonus is clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg oral every 6 to 8 hours; hold dose if blood pressure <90/60 mmHg (0.1 to 0.2 mg 2 to 4 times daily is commonly used in the outpatient setting); recommend test dose (0.1 mg oral) with blood pressure check 1 hour post dose; obtain daily blood pressure checks; increasing dose requires additional blood pressure checks; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; taper to stop; average duration 15 days. The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment. Gabapentin can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and help with pain, anxiety, and sleep. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Tizanidine is as follows: 4 mg three times daily, can increase to 8 mg three times daily.",What to consider to reduce withdrawal symptoms during the taper?,use of adjuvant medications
Algorithm,"Module D is for patients currently on opioid therapy. For patients currently on OT, look for factors that would require immediate attention and possible discontinuation of OT due to unacceptable risk. If there are factors that would require immediate attention, then admit/provide treatment to stabilize, including opioid tapering or SUD treatment as indicated. If there are no factors that would require immediate attention, then obtain a biopsychosocial assessment. If prior medical records including current prescriber, prior and current UDT, PDMP are available for review, then review data and re-assess risks and benefits of continuing OT and consider strength and number of risk factors. If unavailable, then address factors related to incomplete data prior to prescribing. Then review data and re-assess risks and benefits of continuing OT and consider strength and number of risk factors. If risks outweigh benefits of continuing OT, then proceed to module C. If risks do not outweigh benefits of continuing OT, then educate/re-educate on the following: non-opioid management, self-management to improve function and quality of life, realistic expectations and limitations of medical treatment options, preferred treatment methods being non-pharmacotherapy and non-opioid pharmacotherapy, new information on risks and lack of benefits of long-term OT. After educating/re-educating the patient, identify if there is presence of prescribed opioid dose>90 mg MEDD or combined sedating medication that increases risk of adverse events (e.g., benzodiazepine) or patient non-participation in a comprehensive pain care plan or other indications for tapering. If any of these are present, then proceed to module C. Otherwise, reassess and optimize preferred non-opioid treatments for chronic pain (e.g., physical and psychological treatments) recognizing that the patient is willing to continue to engage in a comprehensive treatment plan including non-opioid treatments. If the patient is experiencing clear functional improvement with minimal risk, then continue OT using the following approach: shortest duration, using lowest effective dose (recognizing that no dose is completely safe and overdose risk increases at doses > 20-50 mg MEDD), continual assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects. Then proceed to follow-up frequently based on patient risk factors. Otherwise, proceed to module C. ",What to do if the patient is prescribed opioid dose>90 mg MEDD?,proceed to module C
Algorithm,"Module A is about determination of appropriateness for opioid therapy. Note: Non-pharmacologic and non-opioid pharmacologic therapies are preferred for chronic pain. If a patient is with chronic pain and has been on daily OT for pain for more than 3 months, then proceed to module D.

Then educate or re-educate on non-opioid management, self-management to improve function and quality of life, realistic expectations and limitations of medical treatment. Then implement and optimize non-opioid treatments for chronic pain (e.g., physical, psychological, and complementary and integrative treatments). If the treatments are effective in managing pain and optimizing function, then exit algorithm; manage with non-opioid modalities. If the treatments are not effective in managing pain and optimizing function, then complete opioid risk assessment and see if patient risks outweigh benefits by considering strength and number of risk factors and patient preference. If patient risk outweighs benefits, then see whether referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated (e.g., mental health, SUD, more intensive interdisciplinary care). If referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated, then refer/consult with appropriate interdisciplinary treatments. Then after referral/consultation with appropriate interdisciplinary treatments, see if the patient is willing to engage in a comprehensive pain care plan.

Features and overview,"Follow up in the first 1 to 4 weeks of taper. If Veteran feels supported and is adjusting to the dose reduction, continue the strategy of reducing to morphine SR 30 mg every 8 hours, follow up in 1 to 4 weeks to determine the next step in the taper. If Veteran strongly resists reduction, then request mental health support and consider the possibility of OUD. If the Veteran is resisting further dose reductions, explore the reason for the reluctance. The reasons for the reluctance can be medical (increased pain), mental health (worsening depression, anxiety, etc.), and substance use disorder (SUD)/opioid use disorder (OUD).

Background information,"QTc interval >450 ms for using methadone: Unlike most other commonly used opioids, methadone has unique pharmacodynamic properties that can prolong the QTc interval (the heart rate’s corrected time interval from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) and precipitate torsades de pointes, a dangerous or fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Patients who may be at risk include those with other risk factors for QTc prolongation, current or prior electrocardiograms (ECGs) with a prolonged QTc >450 ms, or a history of syncope. Therefore, ECGs before and after initiating methadone are highly advised (see Methadone Dosing Guidance). ",What is torsades de pointes?,a dangerous or fatal cardiac arrhythmia
Background information,"Chronic pain is defined as pain lasting three months or more. It is often associated with changes in the  central nervous system (CNS) known as central sensitization.

Recommendations,"As substance misuse in patients on LOT is more than 30% in some series,[107] UDT and confirmatory  testing is used as an additional method of examining for patient substance misuse and adherence to the  prescribed regimen. UDTs, used in the appropriate way, help to address safety, fairness, and trust with OT.  Availability of accurate and timely confirmatory testing (e.g., gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  [GCMS]) is critical due to the false positive and negative rates associated with UDTs.[53] Interpretation of a  UDT and confirmatory results requires education and knowledge of the local procedures and clinical  scenario. Local education and access to expert interpretation is necessary. UDT results are helpful and can help identify active SUD or possible diversion. Accordingly, clinicians should obtain UDT prior to initiating or continuing LOT and periodically thereafter. When a patient is referred for  SUD treatment or is engaged in on-going treatment there should be close communication between the  SUD and pain management providers. The ideal approach is an interdisciplinary format (see  Recommendation 16). For more information, see Appendix B on UDT and confirmatory testing. ",When should clinicians obtain UDT?,prior to initiating or continuing LOT and periodically thereafter
Recommendations,"In addition to non-pharmacological therapies (e.g., exercise, CBT), appropriate mechanism and condition specific non-opioid pharmacologic agents should be tried and optimized before consideration of opioid  medications (e.g., gabapentin in neuropathic pain states).[83] Potential contraindications and long-term  risks of use should be considered for non-opioid pharmacologic agents as well, as these also can carry risk  of harm, depending on the specific patient and chosen medication. ",What is an example of opioid medications?,gabapentin in neuropathic pain states
Background information,"Evidence for or history of diversion of controlled substances: The clinician should communicate to patients that drug diversion is a crime and constitutes an absolute contraindication to prescribing additional medications. Because suspicion is subjective and may be based on impression, bias, or prejudice, it is important that providers who suspect diversion base treatment plans on objective evidence. Suspicions may be confirmed by a negative mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography UDT for the substance being prescribed in the absence of withdrawal symptoms in someone who is receiving opioids. A negative UDT for the prescribed opioid could also by itself be a sign of diversion. Signs of diversion may also include frequent requests for early refills or atypically large quantities required to control pain. Routine UDT, however, may not reliably detect synthetic opioids (e.g., methadone, fentanyl, tramadol) or semi-synthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone). When there is evidence that the patient is diverting opioids, discontinue opioids according to Recommendations 14 and 15 and assess for underlying OUD and/or psychiatric comorbidities. Consultation with a pain specialist, psychiatrist, or SUD specialist may be warranted. Also consider consultation with local risk management and/or counsel. For patients with OUD, keep in mind that sudden discontinuation of opioids due to suspected diversion may place them at high risk for illicit opioid use and resulting opioid overdose (see Recommendation 17).","When may consultation with a pain specialist, psychiatrist, or SUD specialist be warranted?",When there is evidence that the patient is diverting opioids
Features and overview,"Short-term oral medications can be utilized to assist with managing the withdrawal symptoms, especially when prescribing fast tapers. Do not treat withdrawal symptoms with an opioid or benzodiazepine. Withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening and may not be seen with a gradual taper. Early symptoms take hours to days to appear. Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone). Some symptoms of withdrawal such as dysphoria, insomnia and prolonged craving may take longer. Patients with chronic pain may find that symptoms, such as fatigue, mental functioning, pain, and well-being, improve over time.",Which symptoms of withdrawal may take longer?,"dysphoria, insomnia"
Features and overview,"The treatment options for anxiety, dysphoria, lacrimation, and rhinorrhea are hydroxyzine 25 to 50 mg three times a day as needed, diphenhydramine 25 mg every 6 hours as needed. Avoid diphenhydramine for Veterans older than 65 years. The treatment options for myalgias are NSAIDs (e.g., naproxen 375 to 500 mg twice daily or ibuprofen 400 to 600 mg four times daily), acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours as needed, topical medications like menthol/methylsalicylate cream, lidocaine cream/ointment. For NSAIDs, be cautious for patients with risk of GI bleed, renal compromise, cardiac disease. The treatment option for sleep disturbance is Trazodone 25 to 300 mg orally at bedtime.","For NSAIDs, be cautious for which patients?","patients with risk of GI bleed, renal compromise, cardiac disease"
Algorithm,"Module C is on tapering or discontinuation of opioid therapy. If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient’s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics.

(2015) (n=487,462) found that a  diagnosis of a mood disorder was significantly associated with suicide attempts for the chronic use of short-acting and long-acting opioids compared with no diagnosis of a mood disorder.[61] In a study of patients on opioids, Campbell et al. (2015) reported that those with bipolar disorder had 2.9 times the odds of suicidal ideation within the past 12 months as well as 3.2  times the odds of a lifetime suicide attempt compared to those with no bipolar disorder.[62] See  Recommendation 8 and the VA/DoD Suicide CPG2 for more information on suicidality. See the  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Bipolar Disorder in Adults (VA/DoD BD  CPG) for more information on bipolar disorder.3 Merrill and colleagues found that high dose chronic opioid therapy for pain was associated with depressed mood.[63] Treatment for chronic pain with movement, exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for pain may have benefits in treating depression, PTSD, and in reducing suicide risk.[64]  ",What are the odds of suicidal ideation within the past 12 months in those with bipolar disorder compared to those with no bipolar disorder?,2.9 times
Recommendations,"Recognizing the lack of evidence of long-term benefit associated with LOT used alone and the risks of  harms with use of opioids without risk mitigation, dosing determinations should be individualized based  upon patient characteristics and preferences, with the goal of using the lowest dose of opioids for the  shortest period of time to achieve well-defined functional treatment goals. Understandably, there will be  greater mortality, co-occurring medical conditions, and other adverse events in patients who require  higher doses of opioids, even in those who benefit from such therapy. When closer follow-up is needed,  healthcare resources and patient adherence should be considered.

Features and overview,"When a decision is made to taper, special attention must be given to ensure that the Veteran does not feel abandoned. Prior to any changes being made in opioid prescribing, a discussion should occur between the Veteran, family members/caregivers, and the provider either during a face-to-face appointment or on the telephone. The strategies that will help in the transition are discussion, asking about goals, educating the veteran. Discussion includes listening to the Veteran’s story, letting the Veteran know that you believe that their pain is real, using Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques to acknowledge the Veteran’s fears about tapering. Include family members or other supporters in the discussion. Asking about goals includes drawing out their goals for life, having the Veteran fill out the PHI, asking how we can support them during the taper. The drawn-out life goals should not be just being pain-free. PHI is the Personal Health Inventory.  ",Who to include in the discussion?,family members or other supporters
Recommendations,"While there is currently no evidence in the literature documenting the benefit of LOT that demonstrates  improvement in pain and function, we recognize that in a rare subset of individuals a decision to initiate  LOT may be considered (e.g., for intermittent severe exacerbations of chronic painful conditions). If a  decision is made to initiate LOT, a careful assessment of benefits and risks should be made to ensure that  the benefits are expected to outweigh the well-documented risks. In addition, prior to this consideration, a  multimodal treatment plan should be integrated into the patient’s care. Once opioid therapy is initiated,  all opioid risk mitigation strategies outlined in this guideline (see Recommendation 7) should be put into  place.  ",What does the literature say about the the benefit of LOT?,there is currently no evidence in the literature documenting the benefit of LOT that demonstrates  improvement in pain and function
Recommendations,"We strongly recommend against initiation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. We recommend alternatives to opioid therapy such as self-management strategies and other non-pharmacological treatments. When pharmacologic therapies are used, we recommend non-opioids over opioids.

Note: Consideration of opioid therapy beyond 90 days requires reevaluation and discussion with patient of risks and benefits.",Self-management strategies are recommended as alternatives to what?,opioid therapy
Algorithm,"The components of biopsychosocial assessment are pain assessment, patient functional goals, impact of pain on family, work, life, review of previous diagnostic studies, additional consultations and referrals, coexisting illness and treatments and effect on pain, significant psychological, social, or behavioral factors that may affect treatment, family history of chronic pain, collateral of family involvement, patient beliefs/knowledge of the cause of their pain and their treatment preferences along with the perceived efficacy of various treatment options. For patients already on OT, include assessment of psychological factors related to continuing vs. tapering OT. The psychological factors are beliefs, expectations, fears. Pain assessment includes history, physical exam, comorbidities, previous treatment and medications, duration of symptoms, onset and triggers. Examples of absolute contraindications to initiating opioid therapy for chronic pain are true life-threatening allergy to opioids, active SUD, elevated suicide risk, concomitant use of benzodiazepines.

Background information,"With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in March 2010, the  Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee was created to coordinate pain research efforts  throughout federal government agencies. The Committee was tasked with summarizing advances in pain  care research, identifying gaps in research, and developing recommendations regarding ways to minimize  duplicative efforts, disseminate pain care information, and expand public/private research partnerships  and collaborations. The Committee published the National Pain Strategy in March 2016 in response to the  call from the National Academy of Medicine to increase awareness of pain as a significant public health  issue in the U.S. The strategy made recommendations in a number of areas including prevention and  care, professional education and training, and population research.

Background information,"Current or history of SUD: For patients with untreated SUD, see Recommendation 4. For  patients with diagnosed OUD, see Recommendation 17. Frequent requests for early refills or atypically large quantities required to control pain can signal an emerging SUD as well as  diversion (see Evidence for or history of diversion of controlled substances). See the VA/DoD  SUD CPG.4 Depression or history of depression: Zedler et al. (2014) reported that among patients  being treated by the VHA system that received opioids, a history of depression was  significantly associated with opioid-related toxicity/overdose compared to no history of  depression.[58] LOT has been associated with worsening depressive symptoms.[63] See the  VA/DoD MDD CPG.5 PTSD: Seal et al. (2012) (n=15,676) noted that among patients on OT, a prevalence of self inflicted injuries was significantly higher among patients with a history of PTSD (with or  without other mental health diagnoses) as compared to patients with other (or no) mental  health diagnoses.[65] For more information, see the VA/DoD PTSD CPG.6 History of drug overdose: A history of overdose is a red flag and providers should proceed with  utmost caution when considering LOT for these patients.

Algorithm,"Module A is about determination of appropriateness for opioid therapy. Note: Non-pharmacologic and non-opioid pharmacologic therapies are preferred for chronic pain. If a patient is with chronic pain and has been on daily OT for pain for more than 3 months, then proceed to module D. If a patient is with chronic pain and has not been on daily OT for pain for more than 3 months, then obtain biopsychosocial assessment. Then educate or re-educate on non-opioid management, self-management to improve function and quality of life, realistic expectations and limitations of medical treatment. Then implement and optimize non-opioid treatments for chronic pain (e.g., physical, psychological, and complementary and integrative treatments). If the treatments are effective in managing pain and optimizing function, then exit algorithm; manage with non-opioid modalities. If the treatments are not effective in managing pain and optimizing function, then complete opioid risk assessment and see if patient risks outweigh benefits by considering strength and number of risk factors and patient preference. If patient risk outweighs benefits, then see whether referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated (e.g., mental health, SUD, more intensive interdisciplinary care). If referral/consultation for evaluation and treatment is indicated, then refer/consult with appropriate interdisciplinary treatments.

Recommendations,"There is a large variation in patient preference regarding the concurrent use of benzodiazepines and LOT.  This is especially true for patients who are already accustomed to receiving both medications (see Patient  Focus Group Methods and Findings). Concurrent benzodiazepine and LOT use is a serious risk factor for  unintentional overdose death and should be weighed heavily in the risk-benefit evaluation for tapering  versus continuing one or both agents. Once initiated, benzodiazepines can be challenging to discontinue due to symptoms related to benzodiazepine dependence, exacerbations of PTSD, and/or anxiety.[91]  Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines should be avoided, as it can lead to serious adverse  effects including seizures and death. Tapering benzodiazepines should be performed with caution and  within a team environment when possible (see Recommendation 26 in the VA/DoD SUD CPG).7 Due to the  difficulty of tapering or discontinuing benzodiazepines, particular caution should be used when considering initiating benzodiazepines for Veterans with PTSD who have co-occurring chronic pain. The VA/DoD PTSD  CPG recommends against benzodiazepines for the prevention of PTSD and cautions against their use in  treatment of PTSD. Benzodiazepines to treat acute anxiety symptoms after trauma are associated with a  higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. For treatment of PTSD, there is evidence of lack of efficacy from small  clinical trials and evidence of harm from observational studies of benzodiazepines for PTSD. Although  anxiety may initially improve with benzodiazepines, the improvement is short-lived and may result in  tolerance to increasing doses and eventual failure of the treatment. Even gradual benzodiazepine taper  may result in exacerbation of severe PTSD symptoms. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines is considered a  contraindication to initiation of OT.  ",What kind of risk is associated with concurrent benzodiazepine and LOT use?,unintentional overdose death
Recommendations,We recommend tapering to reduced dose or to discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy when risks of long-term opioid therapy outweigh benefits. Note: Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided unless required for immediate safety concerns.

Note: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific tapering strategies and schedules.,When is it recommended to taper to reduced dose or to discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy?,when risks of long-term opioid therapy outweigh benefits
Features and overview,"Follow-up for tapering should be done with PACT Team. Follow-up for tapering is recommended to be a team function with various team members taking on roles in which they have demonstrated specific competencies. Mental health practitioners may need to be included in the follow-up plan. During the slowest taper, follow up with the Veteran 1 to 4 weeks after starting taper then monthly before each reduction. During the slower taper, follow up with the Veteran 1 to 4 weeks after starting taper then monthly before each reduction. During the faster taper, follow up with the Veteran weekly before each dose reduction. During the rapid taper, follow up with the Veteran daily before each dose reduction or if available offer inpatient admission. The follow-up during the slowest, slower, and faster tapering can be done in the clinic and/or over telephone. The follow-up during the rapid tapering can be done in the hospital, clinic or over telephone. Providers will need to determine whether a telephone or in-clinic appointment is appropriate based on the risk category of the Veteran. A Veteran with high risk due to a medical condition may have decompensation during the taper and may require a clinic visit over telephone follow-up. If there are issues with the Veteran obtaining outside prescriptions or they are displaying other aberrant behaviors during the taper, providing follow-up in a clinic visit may be more optimal than a telephone visit.

Background information,"The risk factors with the greatest impact on the development of opioid-related adverse events are the duration and dose of opioid analgesic use. Beyond duration and dose of OT, many factors increase the risk of adverse outcomes and must be considered prior to initiating or continuing OT (Box 1). Given the insufficient evidence of benefit for LOT, the clinician must carefully weigh harms and benefits and educate the patient as well as his or her family or caregiver prior to proceeding with treatment. As patient values and preferences may be impacted by other clinical considerations, some patients with one or more risk factors for adverse outcomes may differ with the clinician’s assessment that the risks of OT  outweigh the potential for modest short-term benefits. Thus, it is important to consider patients’ values and concerns, address misconceptions, express empathy, and fully explain to patients with one or more risk factors that they may not benefit from, and may even be harmed by, treatment with OT. Conditions that significantly increase the risk of adverse outcomes from LOT are listed below. Patients for whom LOT is initiated should be carefully monitored, and ongoing assessment of risk should be performed with vigilance for the development of additional risk factors and adverse outcomes (see Recommendations  7-9). Consider consultation with appropriate specialty care providers if there is uncertainty about whether the benefits of OT, such as improved function (e.g., return-to-work), outweigh the risks. ",What should be done for patients for whom LOT is initiated?,"should be carefully monitored, and ongoing assessment of risk should be performed with vigilance for the development of additional risk factors and adverse outcomes"
Recommendations,"We recommend implementing risk mitigation strategies upon initiation of long-term opioid  therapy, starting with an informed consent conversation covering the risks and benefits of opioid  therapy as well as alternative therapies.

Recommendations,"Community-based Needle Exchange Programs or Syringe Service Programs: Nearly 80% of new users of injectable opioids had previously used prescription oral opioid pain medication.[118,119] Illicit use of injectable opioids is accompanied by an increased rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis infection. Community-based needle exchange programs have been shown to be an effective risk mitigation strategy for reducing high-risk behaviors (e.g., sharing needles) and infectious disease transmission among injection drug users.[120] For those patients who develop OUD and progress to intravenous drug use, the first recommendation should be for medication assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD (see Recommendation 17). For patients who decline MAT for OUD,  clinicians should consider educating the patient regarding sterile injection techniques and community based needle exchange programs, if programs are available. The 2015 outbreak of HIV/hepatitis in rural  Indiana and subsequent successful implementation of a needle exchange program is an example of the threat to rural communities from non-prescription opioid use and the potential benefits of needle exchange programs for use as a risk mitigation strategy.[121,122]  ",What is an example of high-risk behaviors?,sharing needles

Recommendations,"Prior to initiating OT, an individualized assessment of potential opioid-related harms relative to realistic treatment goals must be completed. After initiating OT, frequent visits contribute to the appropriate use and adjustment of the planned therapy.  The Work Group recommends follow-up at least every three months or more frequently (see  Recommendation 7 and Recommendation 11) due to the balance of benefits and harms associated with this recommendation. Although the 2010 OT CPG recommended follow-up every six months, this recommended interval for follow-up and reassessment has not been sufficient to reduce the potential harm associated with LOT or adequately implement comprehensive biopsychosocial pain care. More frequent follow-up is needed in order to increase the impact of risk mitigation strategies and enhance the delivery of comprehensive, biopsychosocial pain care. Frequency of visits should thereafter be based on risk stratification. Similarly, the CDC guideline for OT recommends re-evaluating harms versus benefits within one to four weeks of starting OT or at any dose change, and at least every three months or more frequently if needed.[132]  ",What to do after initiating OT?,frequent visits contribute to the appropriate use and adjustment of the planned therapy

Recommendations,"All patients who take opioids chronically are at risk for OUD and overdose, but especially those who are  younger than 30 years of age. Seven studies were identified that examined age as a predictor of OUD,  respiratory/CNS depression, and/or overdose. Four of the seven studies were rated as fair quality  evidence,[59,86,88,92] while three were rated as poor quality evidence.[58,62,87] Six of the seven studies  demonstrated that age was inversely associated with the risk of OUD and overdose.[59,62,86-88,92] One  of the three low quality studies showed that older subjects had a higher HR of overdose.[58] The Work  Group’s overall confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.
